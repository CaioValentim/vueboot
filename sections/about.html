    <h1>About the Project</h1>
</div>
<p>VueBoot is a project designed to ease the use of Bootstrap in VueJS applications. It takes the approach that the Bootstrap team has done a lot of hard work, and reproducing that work is beyond this project's scope. Because of that, we choose to use the official Bootstrap javascript, and simply wrap the API in a thin VueJS wrapper.</p>

    <h3>Dependencies</h3>
</div>
<p>VueBoot has the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> (requires v1.0+, tested with v1.0.10). Any version of v1.0 should work fine.</li>
    <li><a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> (requires v4.0.0, tested with v4.0.0-alpha). Both the CSS and the JS are required, as is <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, for the Bootstrap JS.</li>
</ul>
